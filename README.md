# hello-world
I'm from Brazil but live in the UK. I've studied Business Administration as well as Computing and Information Systems. My area of expertise is data analysis. I have over 5 years of experience as a Sales Analyst, and have helped business grow by offering insights based on their data that support decision making. 
I'm also a mum to a lovely 2y old toddler (2021) he keeps me honest and focused :)
